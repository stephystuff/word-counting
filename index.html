    <h1> Word Counting </h1>


    <p class='sonnet'> Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
      Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy:
      Why lov'st thou that which thou receiv'st not gladly,
      Or else receiv'st with pleasure thine annoy?
      If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
      By unions married do offend thine ear,
      They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
      In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear:
      Mark how one string sweet husband to another,
      Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;
      Resembling sire, and child, and happy mother,
      Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
      Whose speechless song being many, seeming one,
      Sings this to thee, 'Thou single wilt prove none'.
